    "## Algorithm Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "I will write a cosine similarity algorithm. Given 2 vectors of n-dimensions, it will compute the cosine of t he angle between each vector, returning the top N most similar vectors pointing in the closest direction to the original vector. Since we're working in positive space where no elements of any vector are < 0,  the cosine will be [0,1] bound. Cosine = 0 is a perpendicular n-dimensional angle representing maximum independence between vectors. Cosine = 1 means a 0 degree angle representing an identical orientation or direction of the compared vectors. Cosine will only assess directional relationships, and disregards magnitudes. In other words, we're measuring resemblances and not absolute distances between data points. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is useful in situations where you are concerned more about how closely the direction of two vectors move instead of their closeness/distance from each other in space.\n",
    "\n",
