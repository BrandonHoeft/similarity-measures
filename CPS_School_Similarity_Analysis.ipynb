    "\n",
    "I will write a cosine similarity algorithm that, given 2 vectors of n-dimensions that will compute the direction resemblance between them, returning a value between -1 and 1. But since we're working in positive space where no elements of any vector are < 0,  the cosine will be [0,1] bound. Cosine = 0 is a perpendicular n-dimensional angle representing maximum independence between vectors, while cosine = 1 means a 0 degree angle representing identical orientation or direction of the compared vectors.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Cosine similarity is useful in situations where you are concerned more about the direction of two objects being compared as opposed to their magnitudes. It also works well on sparse vectors where 0's or missing information may be present. If [similarity in magnitudes between vectors is primarily important](https://www.quora.com/Is-cosine-similarity-effective), than a simple dot product or Euclidean distance calculation may be more appropriate.
